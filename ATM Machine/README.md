# ATM Machine 🔧

## What is this?
A simple console-based ATM simulation that demonstrates core banking operations: PIN entry/verification, balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal. This project is useful for practicing conditional logic, user input validation and file/state handling.

## How it works
- The program prompts the user to enter a PIN and verifies it (hard-coded or stored).
- The user can choose actions: check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or exit.
- The script updates the stored balance accordingly and shows results.

**Main script:** `ATM machine.py`

### Example usage
1. Run: `python "ATM machine.py"`
2. Follow prompts to enter PIN and choose operations.

### Notes
- Uses Python standard library only (no external dependencies).
- You can extend it by persisting state to a file (simple JSON or text file) or adding more account features.

## Summary
This small project helps you practice program flow, input validation, and basic state management — perfect for beginners building confidence with Python.
