# Downloading Image

A tiny utility that downloads images from a given URL using `requests` and saves them locally.

**Main script:** `Download_Image.py`

How to run:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install requests`
2. Run: `python Download_Image.py` and provide the image URL when prompted.

This demonstrates basic HTTP requests and file I/O in Python.
