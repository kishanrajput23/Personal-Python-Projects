# Chess Game ♟️

## What is this?
A basic chess demonstration that sets up a board and provides simple move handling. It’s intended as a learning exercise on representing game state and implementing rules.

## Features
- Board initialization and display.
- Simple move input and basic validation (may be partial).
- Can be extended to include full rules, check/checkmate detection, GUI, or AI.

**Main script:** `Chess Game.py`

### How to run
1. Run: `python "Chess Game.py"`
2. Follow on-screen instructions to enter moves (example notation may vary).

## Summary
This project is ideal for practicing data structures (board representation), rule-based checks and optionally integrating a GUI (Tkinter/Pygame) or implementing a simple AI opponent.
