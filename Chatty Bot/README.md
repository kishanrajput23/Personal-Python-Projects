# Chatty Bot 🤖

## What is this?
A simple rule-based chatbot demonstrating input parsing, pattern matching, and generating basic conversational responses in the console.

## How it works
- Prompts user for text input and matches keywords or patterns to select canned responses.
- Useful for learning string manipulation and control flow.

**Main script:** `chatty bot.py`

### Example
- Run the script and enter "hi" or "hello" to see a greeting response.

## Summary
A great hands-on project for beginners to understand basic dialogue flow without using complex NLP libraries; extendable to use libraries like `nltk` or `transformers` for more advanced behavior.
