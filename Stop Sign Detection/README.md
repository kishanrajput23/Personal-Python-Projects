# Stop Sign Detection 🚦

## What is this?
A computer vision demo that detects stop signs in images or live video using OpenCV and a Haar cascade (XML) classifier.

**Files:** `Stop_sign_detection.py`, `stop_data.xml`

### How it works
- The Haar cascade is loaded and applied to frames from an image or camera feed.
- Detected regions are highlighted with bounding boxes.

### How to run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python`
2. Ensure `stop_data.xml` is present and run: `python Stop_sign_detection.py`

## Summary
A compact, practical example to learn object detection with classical CV techniques (Haar cascades) and to explore OpenCV video/image processing.
