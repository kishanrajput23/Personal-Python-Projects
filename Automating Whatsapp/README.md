# Automating WhatsApp 📲

## What is this?
A utility script that demonstrates sending or scheduling messages on WhatsApp programmatically using libraries such as `pywhatkit` or browser automation via Selenium.

## How it works
- `pywhatkit` can send messages to contacts by opening WhatsApp Web in the browser and scheduling a short time later for the message to be sent.
- Alternatively, Selenium can be used for more advanced interactions (login, browse UI, send media).

**Main script:** `Automate Whatsapp.py`

### Quick start
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pywhatkit`
2. Run: `python "Automate Whatsapp.py"` and follow prompts (you may need to scan WhatsApp Web QR once).

### Security/note
- This approach relies on WhatsApp Web behavior and may break if WhatsApp updates its UI.
- Avoid automating actions that violate terms of service; use responsibly.

## Summary
This project is great for learning simple automation, scheduling tasks, and interacting with web-based services using Python.
